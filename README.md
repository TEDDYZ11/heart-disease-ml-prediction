# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses multiple supervised learning models to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical attributes. The dataset is sourced from online and includes key health indicators such as cholesterol, blood pressure, age, and exercise-induced angina.

---

## Dataset

- **File**: `heartdisease.csv`
- **Target**: `target` (1 = heart disease present, 0 = not present)
- **Features**: `age`, `sex`, `cp` (chest pain type), `trestbps`, `chol`, `thalach`, `exang`, etc.

---

## Models Used

The notebook tests and compares the performance of four machine learning classifiers:

| Model                     | Description                            |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Logistic Regression**  | Baseline classification model          |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors**  | Simple, instance-based learner (K=7)   |
| **Decision Tree**        | Tree-based split on feature thresholds |
| **Random Forest**        | Ensemble model of multiple decision trees |

## Project Conclusion

Among all models tested, the Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy, making it the most effective at predicting heart disease in this dataset.  
Logistic Regression also performed well with high interpretability, while KNN and Decision Tree showed slightly lower predictive performance.  
The results demonstrate that ensemble models like Random Forest can provide strong predictive power for health-related classification tasks.
